      <p>Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, generally on the east side of the United States. Still love camping and getting out in the vastness of nature. Interestingly enough, lived in Russia about a year when I was in middle school, high school, and went to college in New York City. Came back to Pittsburgh and did grad school at Carnegie Mellon.</p>
      
      <p>After about 7 really amazing years at Eaton, I actually moved to Germany through the COVID years and turned it into a permanent home with my family including 2 awesome kids. We live in the Cologne-Düsseldorf region, so although I don't have the same closeness to nature, we do have great local culture and our family enjoys traveling all over the area.</p>
      
      <p>Currently managing a team in Portugal among other places, working with a global team, and I'm currently working with Hexagon building their platform for manufacturing digital thread.</p>
