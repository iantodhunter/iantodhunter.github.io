### Designing for Critical Operations: Eaton's Power Xpert (Now Brightlayer)

For several years, I led and supported design efforts on Eatonâ€™s Power Xpert Management platform (now Brightlayer), collaborating with a team of 4-5 designers. My work spanned multiple critical applications and the development of a scalable design system.

**Key Project Highlights**:
- **Research-Driven Design**: Conducted extensive research through site visits and operator interviews to understand:
  - Manual inspections ("walkabouts") for leaks, temperature fluctuations, and gas hazards.
  - Critical factors for operators: sensor placement, alerting thresholds, and minimizing alarm fatigue.
- **App Suite**: Designed and revealed apps like:
  - **Brightlayer Industrial**
  - **Asset Manager**
  - **Remote Monitoring Tools** (in partnership with WellAware)
  - **Power Monitoring Software**
  - White-label versions for customized client needs.

**Impact**:
- Reduced manual inspections through real-time alerts and remote monitoring tools.
- Tackled alarm fatigue with user-centered design focused on operational efficiency.
