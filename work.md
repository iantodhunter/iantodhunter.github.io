  <div class="case-meta">
    <span class="case-role">Lead Designer & Product Manager</span>
    <span class="case-duration">2020-2024</span>
    <span class="case-impact">0→1 platform serving 10,000+ users</span>
  </div>

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>Eaton Brightlayer is a comprehensive industrial IoT platform that transforms how manufacturing facilities monitor and manage critical infrastructure. As the lead designer and product manager, I oversaw the complete design and development process, from initial concept to market launch.</p>

  <h3>The Challenge</h3>
  <p>Industrial facilities needed a unified platform to monitor diverse systems (electrical, mechanical, environmental) but existing solutions were fragmented, complex, and expensive. Eaton wanted to create a platform that could serve multiple industries while maintaining simplicity and reliability.</p>

  <h3>My Role</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Design Leadership:</strong> Managed a team of 8 designers across UX, UI, and industrial design</li>
    <li><strong>Product Strategy:</strong> Defined product roadmap and feature priorities</li>
    <li><strong>Design System:</strong> Created comprehensive design system with React component library</li>
    <li><strong>User Research:</strong> Conducted extensive field research with industrial engineers and facility managers</li>
    <li><strong>Prototyping:</strong> Led rapid prototyping and user testing cycles</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Key Deliverables</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Design System:</strong> 200+ reusable components with comprehensive documentation</li>
    <li><strong>Platform Architecture:</strong> Unified dashboard for monitoring multiple industrial systems</li>
    <li><strong>Mobile App:</strong> Companion app for field engineers and maintenance staff</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics Dashboard:</strong> Real-time insights and predictive maintenance alerts</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Impact</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>10,000+ active users</strong> across 500+ facilities</li>
    <li><strong>40% reduction</strong> in system downtime through predictive alerts</li>
    <li><strong>iF Design Award</strong> for Industrial Remote Monitoring App</li>
    <li><strong>$15M+ revenue</strong> generated in first 18 months</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Technologies & Tools</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Design:</strong> Figma, Sketch, Principle</li>
    <li><strong>Development:</strong> React, TypeScript, Node.js</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> Tableau, Custom dashboards</li>
    <li><strong>Testing:</strong> UserTesting, Field studies</li>
  </ul>
