### Introduction

I'm a Principal Designer. I build and scale design teams, launch digital platforms, and deliver results in industrial and manufacturing. I lead by example, focus on outcomes, and get things done. I work well in global, remote teams and push people to do their best work.

### Experience Highlights
- Led the creation and growth of in-house design teams, earning multiple iF Awards and industry recognition (Hexagon Manufacturing Intelligence, Eaton).
- Built a zero-to-revenue platform at Hexagon, now a portfolio of revenue-generating apps transforming licensing and user management for modern manufacturing.
- Product manager for a 0–1 design system, including a robust React component library and a new, AI-ready design language.
- Seven years at Eaton as Lead Designer, driving innovation in heavy industry, green energy (EV charging), lighting systems, and data center applications. Developed an award-winning design system adopted across business units.
- Currently managing a high-performing, fully remote, global team of designers.

### Shaping the Future of Product Development with AI
I'm at the forefront of exploring how AI will transform the way we develop products—leveraging emerging technologies to create smarter, more adaptive, and efficient solutions. My teams are leading the charge in integrating AI-driven capabilities that redefine what's possible in industrial software and product experiences.
