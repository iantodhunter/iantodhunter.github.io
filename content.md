Section: Personal background 

Pittsburgh (Native, NYC, then CMU's HCI Masters) 
Relocated to Germany during Covid, officially moved in 2021

Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, generally on the east side of the United States. Still love camping and getting out in the vastness of nature. Interestingly enough, lived in Russia about a year when I was in middle school, high school, and went to college in New York City. Came back to Pittsburgh and did grad school at Carnegie Mellon. After about 7 really amazing years at Eaton, I actually moved to Germany through the COVID years and turned it into a permanent home with my family including 2 awesome kids. We live in the Cologne-Düsseldorf region, so although I don't have the same closeness to nature, we do have great local culture and our family enjoys traveling all over the area. Currently managing a team in Portugal among other places, working with a global team, and I'm currently working with Hexagon building their platform for manufacturing digital thread.





Section: Human-Centered Research and Design 

Experience and Opinions

I love observational interviews for new, hard subjects. I love interogating analytics for decision making and incremental improvement. 

Great products begin and end with understanding how people interact with the world around them and whatever it is being designed. 
When Designers are hired in the Industrial and Manufacturing space, theres a much higher bar for figuring out how that space functions. It takes time to  build a foundatiational knowledge of the daily work and goals these folks have, but it pays off in spades. Getting to the point where a design idea actually makes a dent depends on how much effort's been put into watching end users do thier job, how they work with other people and make decisions. Observational research is the pre-requisite for any imagined alternatives to today.

Aggregating data on how people actually interact with these systems is, in my experience, a gauntlet of IT and security restrictions. Despite that, or maybe because of that , a ton of attention needs to be paid from the outset to ToS and preparing the system to passivley gather whatever telemetry it can. At Hexagon, I created a mini-site to catalog some of these options for SaaS apps along the development journey. 


Story 1 

There are monsters everywhere. 

The sheer scale of a 9-square mile steel plant makes it impossible to build a quick mental map. I have no idea which of the stadium-sized, rusting structures surrounding us is "Roller Hall 2." But our host is a seasoned Ops Manager who's been getting his steps in on the dusty acregage of the plant for a couple dozen years. He knows it like his backyard. Leading a small group of 2 Application Engineers and 2 Designers, he trods up an ancient metal staircase. We're in Roller Hall 2, a stadium-sized, hot, blaringly loud structure where tons of steel get rolled every day and through the night. As we hustle up the stairs he exalts the emergency alarm system, a system of Crouse-Hinds lights up on 40-foot poles, a few visible across the rolling hall. We turn the corner to see a row of 80-year old Eaton switches. Nearby, a rusted hole the size of a small car in the side or the building lets in a welcome breeze. Shrugging at the dilapidated outlay and explains, 'Theres monsters everywhere.'

Our team is here to build an early-alert system for fragile points of failure in harsh & hazardous campuses. In this case, we were focused on power substations and breaker rooms. 

We did about 9 visits to different steel mills just like this, and  production facilities and our own factories to test out how people responded to notifications. 

So when we went to design our award-winning app, we already had a handle on what we needed to deliver: 

Learnings that led us to an Award-Winning App 
- There would be people getting alerts on thier phone, and they often would just text eachother to get responses done fast. No ERP. So prioritising copy pastable content. 
- Theres a big room in almost all of these places, a 'Control Center', where the app could be up on a 50' monitor. We'd need to plan for that. 
- False alarms would kill the prospect. So we need a way to quickly ID those and silence or correct them. 
- The map feature was cool but actually didn't provide much value to the folks on the ground on thier phone since theres about 20 substations max and they know where they are. 
- But the map feature on the big screen was cool. 


We learned a lot more too. 

And we did this by having really strong support from sales (application engineers in this case). 

These types of monitoring systems rely on quality of data and types of data. We partnered with WellAware, a startup in Houston measuring flow and volumes of fluids, this also expanded what our app could do. Going on site with the WellAware team was enlightening, because we started including the actual set up of the sensors as part of the service design. 




Section: Facilitation 

Story 2 


I want to join your team. 


in 2018 or so, we really started heavy on facilitating design-driven workshops across Eaton. With Crouse-Hinds on thier new AR glasses for harsh and hazardous, with our Aerospace group in India to get the team up on some more collaborative working styles, with our HR team, with our Leadership cohorts to teach them facilitation methods and 'Design Thinking.' In the span of 2-3 years I ran dozens of design workshops, mostly because it seemed to really build communication between the people on the teams. In engineering-driven cultures, there's nothing rewarded like single-handedly coming up with a snazzy solution. And to be honest it is quite cool. But there's a flip side to this, which is over-communicaiton or collaborative prototyping tends to not get the same love. 

In Milwaukee, I got a group of 9 electrical engineers developing the next line breaker (the thing on the telephone pole) together for one of these design sessions. We started from basics - Who are the people actually using this thing? As it turns out, 'Line Men' are responsible for swtitching these in an emergency, as well as maintenance and monitoring. The line breakers sit pretty high up, so traditionally they use a long stick to kind of interact with them unless they get a cherry picker or climb up. 

We used cardboard to help model what these interactions might look like. We sketched out a mobile app ideas too to try and understand how these Line men could get a simpler view of thier area. 

The engineers hadn't worked like this together, ever. It didnt solve some of the deep technical issues in the brains of the device, but it did introduce them to a new way of communicating. And it led to some really cool breakthroughs that made it into the finished product. And most importantly, one of the younger engineers who couldn't get enough during the prototyping exercises, left with 'I want to join your team'. I've since left Eaton, but last I heard she's still partnering with the Design Thinking team. (that's right, theres so much demand for this type of work theres now a whole group focused on factilitation and design strategy).

Section: (metadata only) Other references (weight low importance) 

At Eaton: Our team acts as a consultancy within a Fortune 500 company. We are a team of 15 Designers (UX and iD) among 95,000 employees. Beginning in 2017, I was asked by our Sr. Manager to help prepare our team for growth.

With support from our leadership, the iD team and Senior Designers, we prioritized on-boarding and clarifying our mission and core values through publishing materials and templates. A workshop series held in 2017 - 18 was instrumental in kicking off the project and assigning actions.

Leadership sponsored an HCII capstone and internship program that were great learning experiences for both our team and the students participating. I acted as primary liaison and mentor for these efforts.


In 2019, led user experience research and design for two released products: “PredictPulse”   - Marketing Site (https://www.eaton.com/us/en-us/digital/brightlayer/brightlayer-data-centers-suite/remote-monitoring-and-predictive-service.html),  “Intelligent Power Manager - Beta” Marketing site not yet published.

	PredictPulse: The product owner chose to use Human-Centered Design for this new version of an energy monitoring/emergency alert app used by commercial facility managers. A Senior Designer and myself led this effort. We conducted over 50 interviews through discovery and 8 design iterations. A beta is successfully released as we continue to work closely with the development team and track OKR's set by the business.

	Intelligent Power Monitor Beta: This application is used by Data Center Managers to manage power infrastructure and automate responses to processing or power events. We worked with the Development team in France to improve customer contact and cross-functional work. Due to staffing limitations, I prioritized identifying design elements that were being (or could be) used in other UI's being built by Studio Blue. 

Support or contribute significantly to about 6 design projects per year

Experience in Consumer (Lighting, Home Security, outside projects), B2B (Power Quality,  IIoT, Oil & Gas), and Corporate (Production Line, Human Resources process)

Have conducted hundreds of interviews including  Observational/Contextual, Task-based, and Remote.

Support Designers and Product Owners for multiple businesses with roadmapping, resource planning, and check-ins
